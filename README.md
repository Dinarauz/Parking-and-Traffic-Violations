This project analyzes NYC parking and traffic violation data using a 1-million sample from the Department of Finance’s OpenData API. The goal is to uncover trends, identify top violators, and explore actionable improvements in enforcement and policy.

## 🎯 Objective
Identify patterns in 2024 NYC parking violations and provide insights that could inform public policy or influence driver behavior.
