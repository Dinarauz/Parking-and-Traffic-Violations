This project analyzes NYC parking and traffic violation data using a 1-million sample from the Department of Finance’s OpenData API. The analysis aims to uncover trends, identify top violators, and explore potential improvements in traffic enforcement.

**Objective:**
To identify patterns in 2024 NYC parking violations and issue actionable insights that could inform public policy or driver behavior through data analysis.

**Data Source:**
https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Open-Parking-and-Camera-Violations/nc67-uf89/about_data

**Tools & Technologies used**
	• Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Requests)
	•	Deepnote for collaboration
	•	Jupyter Notebook
	•	ChatGPT for troubleshooting support

**Key Findings:**
	•	Passenger vehicles (PAS) accounted for the majority of tickets.
	•	The most frequent violation: School zone speed camera, $50 fine.
	•	Thursdays had the most violations; Sundays the least.
	•	Kings County had the highest ticket count.
	•	Traffic and Transportation agencies issued over 90% of all tickets.
	•	Fine amounts varied inconsistently across agencies, indicating inconsistent enforcement.

 **Limitations:**
 	•	Dataset restricted to 1 million rows (of 122+ million total).
	•	Time-related data like violation time was excluded due to formatting issues.
	•	Limited by absence of data such as driver demographics or registered vehicle counts.
